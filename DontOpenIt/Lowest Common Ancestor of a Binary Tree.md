## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

```
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
         //base case
        if (root == NULL || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

        //result
        if(left == NULL) {
            return right;
        }
        else if(right == NULL) {
            return left;
        }
        else { //both left and right are not null, we found our result
            return root;
        }
    }
};
```
