## 1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers

A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.

Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minPartitions(string n) {
          int max_digit = 0;
        for (char digit: n) {
            max_digit = max(max_digit, digit - '0');
        }
        return max_digit;
    }
};
```
