## 968. Binary Tree Cameras

You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

```
class Solution {
public:
    int res = 0;
    
    int minCameraCover(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        return (dfs(root) < 1 ? 1 : 0) + res;
    }

    int dfs(TreeNode* root) 
    {
        if (!root) return 2;
        int left = dfs(root->left), right = dfs(root->right);
        if (left == 0 || right == 0) 
        {
            res++;
            return 1;
        }
        return left == 1 || right == 1 ? 2 : 0;
    }
};
```
