## 729. My Calendar I

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.

```
class MyCalendar {
public:
   vector<pair<int, int>> booking;
	
    MyCalendar() {
        
    }
    bool book(int start, int end) {
        for (pair<int, int> temp : booking)
        {
            if (max(temp.first, start) < min(end, temp.second))
            {
                return false;
            } 
        }
        booking.push_back({start, end});
        return true;
    }
};

/**
 * Your MyCalendar object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MyCalendar* obj = new MyCalendar();
 * bool param_1 = obj->book(start,end);
 */
```
